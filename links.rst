Add an external links to the shared/external_links or shared shared/api_links file in the following format:

.. |Substitution| raw:: html

  <a href="URL" target="_blank">Text to show user</a>


You then add |Substitution| in the topic where you want the link to be.

Don't add link info directly to topic.  Search the link files to see if the
link you need is already there before adding it.
